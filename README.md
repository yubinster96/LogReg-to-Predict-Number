# LogReg-to-Predict-Number
Using Logistic Regression Model to Predict numbers


trained and tested using sklearn.model_selection -> train_test_split

data set used was: from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

after using a logistic regression model, I predicted random numbers from the data set and also used seaborn and imported metrics from sklearn to visualize confusion matrix

accuracy score was .95~ which is good.. only missed very small number from predicted vs actual
